**Homework List:**
1. *Answer question according to given difference equation.*

2. *Use the same realization of White noise $\varepsilon$'s (set $\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}$ = 1) to simulate and plot the following Gaussian process $Y_{t}$ (set $Y_{0}$ = E($Y_{t}$)) in a sample of size T = 50.*

3. *Use the same realization of White noise $\varepsilon$'s (set $\sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}$ = 1) to simulate and plot the following Gaussian process $Y_{t}$ (set $Y_{0}$ = E($Y_{t}$)) in a sample of size T = 150. Create new random data for each $Y_{t}$ every time before plotting.*

4. *Suppose that the U.S. quarterly seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the period 1948 − 1972 behaves much like the time series: $$Y_{t} - 4.77 = 1.54(Y_{t-1} - 4.77) - 0.67(Y_{t-2} - 4.77) + \varepsilon_{t},$$where the $\varepsilon_{t}$ are uncorrelated random (0, 1) variables. Let us assume that we know that this is the proper representation. The four observations updated to 1972 are $Y_{1972}$ = 5.30, $Y_{1971}$ = 5.53, $Y_{1970}$ = 5.77, and $Y_{1969}$ = 5.83. Please make a best linear forecast of $Y_{1972+s}$, s = 1, 2, 3, 4 based on the information available.*

5. *Build up a stochastic model for the data set teacher gave from Box-Jenkins procedure, and predict values for five periods.*

6. *Plot the impulse response function from a bivariate VAR(4) model with Taiwan's GDP and Stock Index data set.*

7. *Specify a bivariate VAR(4) model for Taiwan’s GDP and Stock Index from this model to test the Granger-causality between these two variables.*

9. *Unit root testing, using Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test, and Phillips-Perron Test to test the given data.*
